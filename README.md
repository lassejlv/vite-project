A fully setup vite template, includes typescript support, tailwind out-of-the-box. Have components in seprate html files, and more!

It also comes with setup `prettier-tailwind-plugin` for better sorting of tailwind classes.

```bash
bun install
```

```bash
bun dev
```

And you are good to go! ðŸš€
